# Open questions

Unsettled. Moved here out of conversation so it survives.

## This repo

**The five thresholds in `simplicity` are borrowed, not chosen.** Cognitive complexity 15, nesting
depth 3, function 50 lines, file 300 lines, parameters 4. These are common SonarJS and ESLint
defaults. They are plausible and unconfirmed, and presenting them as settled is fake precision.

**Repo is private.** Created private as the reversible default, not as a decision. `ai-skills-cobarx`
stays independently shareable, which was the reason for a separate repo at all.

**`docs/essays/` is a coinage.** There is no strong industry term for a post-hoc narrative about
why a practice exists. Oxide's RFDs are the closest published model but are pre-decision. Recorded
as ours per the vocabulary rule, and open to a better name.

**No linting or formatting configured in this repo yet.** A skills repo that preaches lint-from-day-one
and ships without it is its own counterexample. Markdown is the only file type here, so the
question is whether non-code linting counts, which is itself an open question below.

## For `linting`, before it can be written

**How is a linter chosen for a stack?** Settled as an ordered procedure, kept here because it was
agreed and the tool examples still need verifying before they go in the skill:

1. Does the toolchain ship one? If yes that is the answer, unless step 3 disqualifies it.
2. Has the ecosystem converged? Take the dominant tool, not the best one.
3. Can it express the rules our skills require? The only disqualifying check.
4. Fast enough to run on save? Tie-breaker.
5. Escape hatch for a custom rule? Tie-breaker.

Two rule names verified rather than recalled, since they are what make `naming` enforceable:
[`@typescript-eslint/naming-convention`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/naming-convention/)
takes `custom: { regex, match }`, and [`id-denylist`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/id-denylist)
bans generic identifiers by name.

**Does non-code linting belong in scope?** Markdown, YAML, shell. Real, but arguably a different
concern from code quality gates, and including it starts the scope creep this skill is most
vulnerable to.

**How does lint run locally?** Rule 6 of the draft says local and CI share a config, but not *how*
local runs. Pre-commit hook versus editor integration versus a watch task is a tooling choice, and
naming one felt like policy rather than mechanism.

**Should waivers expire?** MetanoiaFramework's `feature-flags` has review-by dates. The same idea
could stop an inline disable outliving its reason. Probably over-engineering for solo work, but it
is the kind of thing that rots quietly.

## Method

**Does "draft long, then keep only what is a rule" need a home of its own?** It generalises past
skill authoring to specs, docs, and any distillation task. Currently it lives only in
`docs/essays/outline-is-the-skill.md` and in `AGENTS.md` as a convention.

**How much proof is enough?** `definition-of-done` says to check every dimension and to scale the
proof to the blast radius. "Exhaustive" and "proportionate" pull against each other, and the line is
not yet drawn. Raised in `docs/essays/define-what-good-looks-like.md`.

**Is survey-then-dive a real pattern**, or an artifact of one probe? Survey first is cheap and
tells you which dive is worth doing, but that is one data point. Raised in
`docs/essays/simplicity-is-not-size.md`.

## Stranded elsewhere

Research for the **playhead** project, including the caption test corpus (Sintel's ~40 languages,
`w3c/imsc-tests` with PNG reference renderings, the real-versus-synthetic fixture split, and the
caution against vendoring OpenSubtitles), currently exists only in the session plan file at
`~/.claude/plans/`. It belongs in `~/code/playhead/docs/` and should be moved there when that
project is next picked up.
