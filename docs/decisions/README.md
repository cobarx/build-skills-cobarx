# Decisions

What has been settled, one record per decision: terse, dated, append-only. The narrative behind a
decision lives in [docs/essays/](../essays/); what is still open lives in
[docs/context/](../context/).

Records follow [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/): `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`, numbered in order
and never reused. The title starts with the name of each skill the decision governs, so the glob at
the foot of a skill (`docs/decisions/*-<skill>-*.md`) finds it; a library-wide decision names no
skill. A reversed decision gets a new record, and the old one is marked superseded. See 0001.
