description: This skill should be used when recording a decision, a follow-up, project knowledge, or working state; when you notice a bug, gap, or risk outside the task at hand; when tempted to leave it in agent memory, a chat, or a PR description; or when deciding where a note should live so the next person or agent can find it. It governs where context lives, not what any single document says.

# durable-context

Context lives in the project, where the next reader, human or agent, will find it.

Context kept in a private store, a chat, or a soon-buried PR description is context no one can find
later. If it matters past this moment, it belongs in the project, in the open.

## Rules

1. **Project context goes in the project, not in private memory or a chat.** Decisions, knowledge,
   and state that others will need live in a repo file or an issue, readable by humans and agents
   alike. A private note about how you yourself operate is the exception, and the only one.

2. **Deferred work is an issue or a tracked file, never a PR description.** A PR body is read once
   and buried; a follow-up has to outlive it.

3. **Index every context file so a reader can reach it from the entry point.** Follow the indexes
   down from the `README` or the agent instructions file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`); in a nested
   project a file's link lives in the nearest index, not the root, and each index points on to the
   next. A file no chain of indexes reaches cannot be found, which is the same as not existing.

4. **Keep it plain and open.** Markdown or the like, readable without a particular tool. If only one
   tool can read it, it is hidden.

5. **One home per kind.** Decisions in `docs/decisions/`, open questions in `docs/context/`,
   rationale in `docs/essays/`, so a reader knows where to look before they look.

6. **A problem you notice is filed, not just mentioned.** A bug, gap, or risk spotted on the way to
   something else goes in the tracker, without asking first, before the work moves on; said only in
   a chat, it is gone when the chat ends. Unsettled severity or an unknown fix is no reason to wait:
   say so in the issue, which is where that discussion belongs. The one exception is the developer's
   to make, never yours to infer: early in a project, areas not expected to work yet can be
   declared, at the entry point or in the moment, and problems there go unfiled.

7. **Working notes stay on their branch.** Notes taken while working are a unit of work like any
   other, kept on their own branch and never merged as they are. What reaches main is sorted by
   kind: each open question, proposed change, settled choice and piece of settled reasoning goes to
   its own home (rules 2 and 5). The rest stays in the branch and its PR.

## Not here

The *form* of a decision record is `decision-log`. Writing a good README or laying out a project is
`organize`. This governs *where* context lives and that it can be found, not the content of any one
document.
