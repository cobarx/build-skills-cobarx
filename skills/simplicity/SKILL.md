name: simplicity
description: This skill should be used before starting any unit of work; when a task or PR description needs the word "and" to be accurate; when a function grows a third level of nesting; when a new dependency is proposed; when a complexity gate fails; or when asked to do several things at once. It keeps the cost of understanding a change low, so any one part can be reviewed with only its contract in view.

# simplicity

Make every change cheap to understand. Size is the indicator, not the goal: a change is expensive
when reviewing it means holding several unrelated things at once.

A change is anything handed to a reader. A diff, a PR description, a review comment, a reply.

## Rules

1. **One sentence, no "and".** If you cannot describe the unit in one sentence without "and", it is
   more than one unit. An abstraction invented to make the sentence work is a failure, not a pass.

2. **Cross-cutting concerns are peers.** If a thing references three siblings, it belongs beside
   them, never inside one of them.

3. **Sequence dependencies, do not merge them.** A unit that cannot be built without another is an
   ordering problem.

4. **Exceptions, named so the rule survives.** A greenfield first commit, generated code, and
   mechanical refactors are single units regardless of size. Reviewing them does not require
   holding many things in mind at once.

5. **Extract, do not raise the threshold.** Overriding a default is a decision, and gets logged.

6. **Weigh dependencies both ways.** Prefer the platform, which costs neither. Otherwise: twenty
   lines used once are not worth a supply chain, and a module you would implement is not just
   lines but every decision inside it, each one yours to make, justify and maintain. Neither side
   wins by default.

7. **Propose the split.** When asked for too much at once, say so, and give the units and their
   order. State it once; if reaffirmed, proceed.

8. **The cheapest change to review is the one not written.** Reuse before implementing, delete
   before adding, and produce nothing the spec and the standards do not require: no documentation,
   tests, validation, error types, fallbacks, special cases or compatibility shims beyond them.
   Volume is a cost even when every individual piece is small, and it is the cost that rises
   fastest when producing more is nearly free.

   Working notes are not the target. A scratchpad costs nobody but its author, and thinking in
   writing is not the same as shipping prose. The target is output presented as finished.

9. **Touch only what the requirement reaches.** A change to existing code holds that requirement
   and nothing else: no extracting, moving, renaming, re-typing or re-documenting code it does not
   reach. New behaviour goes where the old behaviour lives, in the style already there. If the
   requirement needs the old code restructured first, that is its own unit, landed before it.

## Thresholds

Complexity essential to the problem must be paid for; complexity introduced by the solution is
waste. For code, the thresholds that measure it are in
[references/thresholds.md](references/thresholds.md): load it when writing or reviewing code.

Completion is not here. See `definition-of-done`.
