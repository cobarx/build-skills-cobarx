name: decision-analysis
description: This skill should be used when someone has to choose between options and wants them weighed; when asked for pros and cons, a comparison of approaches, or an analysis before deciding; when the decider distrusts one option and wants to see the case for it; or before a decision is recorded. It governs performing the analysis a decision is made from, not recording the decision.

# decision-analysis

Give the decider what they need to weigh a choice themselves.

The analysis comes first and the record after. A decider handed a verdict can only trust it; one
handed the analysis can check it, and can disagree for reasons the analyst did not have.

## Rules

1. **The decider's criteria come first, objections included.** A preference or an unease the
   decider brings is a criterion. State it in their terms and weigh it like the others; do not
   argue it away. The rest come from the goal (`spec`).

2. **Ask what only the decider can settle.** An unknown the decider can settle is a question, not
   an assumption. Ask when in doubt, and always when an option meets an objection only under a
   reading broader than the decider's own words. Put the questions in the summary.

3. **Measure, do not recall.** Every fact the choice turns on comes from the system in front of
   you or a primary source, with how and when it was obtained. A remembered fact is a lead to check.
   Mark any fact left unchecked; never claim blanket verification.

4. **Give an authority's reason, not only its verdict.** When a maintainer, vendor or project
   recommends an option, say why they recommend it.

5. **Steelman the option the decider resists, starting with why it exists.** The problem it was
   built to solve comes first. Then give its strongest arguments their full weight, and say of each
   whether it applies to this work now.

6. **Recommend one.** Where it loses on a criterion, say why it still wins. No second pick: a
   preference only the decider holds is a question for them (rule 2).

7. **Say what would reverse it.** Give the observable conditions under which the recommendation
   should be revisited.

8. **Open with a summary.** The recommendation and the few reasons that decide it, before any
   detail.

9. **The analysis stands alone.** Write it as a plain file the decider can read without the agent,
   including what could not be checked.

10. **Reread the file before replying.** Look for a claim of verification broader than what was
    checked, a second pick, and a criterion the recommendation loses on without saying why. Fix
    the file, not the reply.

11. **The reply is the summary and the path.** Paste the file's summary exactly as written, then
    its absolute path on its own line. No other information, caveats included; every detail is in
    the file.

## Not here

Recording the decision once made is `decision-log`. Where the analysis file lives is
`durable-context`. The goal the criteria come from is `spec`. Whether to adopt a standard is
`adopting-standards`; which layer's convention wins is `platform-correctness`. This governs
performing the analysis, not making or recording the decision.
